The goal of `bbousuite` is to make it easy to install and load the
(`bbou`) suite of R packages for **B**oreal cari**BOU**.

The packages are designed to analyse (`bbouretro` and `bboutools`) and
simulate (`bbousims`) boreal caribou survival and recruitment data
(`bboudata`) to estimate population growth rates. A shiny app is also
available (`bboushiny`).
