	abstract = {Home range and survival were determined for cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) living in woodlots in southwestern Wisconsin. Home ranges were determined for 25 radio-tagged cottontail rabbits in a 14-acre (5.7-ha) woodlot where fall densities were 3.6 rabbits per acre (0.4 ha). Home range size varied by season, sex, and individual. Adult male home ranges increased from a mean of 6.8 acres (2.8 ha) in spring to a mean of 9.9 acres (4.0 ha) in early summer, then decreased significantly to a mean of 3.8 acres (1.5 ha) in late summer. This decrease coincided with testes regression. Adult female home ranges were largest (mean = 4.3 acres [1.7 ha]) in spring, then decreased significantly to a mean of 2.1 acres (0.8 ha) in early summer and remained about this size until mid-January. Female home ranges did not overlap in late summer. Between mid-September and mid-November the home ranges of four juveniles did not differ in size from 10 adults which showed no difference according to sex. Retreats (holes, woodpiles, junkpiles) were used as daytime resting locations mostly during periods of snow cover. Less than 8 percent of daytime resting locations occurred in agricultural land. Bimonthly survival rates determined radiotelemetrically for 51 cottontails were 0.77, 0.79, 0.94, 0.80, 0.68, and 0.63 for 2-month periods beginning in March, May, July, September, November, and January, respectively. Annual survival calculated from the bimonthly rates was 0.20; mean annual survival determined demographically was 0.15. Cottontail survival appeared to be related to exposure in insecure cover.},

	abstract = {We summarize the demography of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) inhabiting 6 ranges in northeast Alberta, Canada, from 1993 to 2002. Among ranges, mean annual survival of radiomarked adult females averaged 0.88 (range: 0.86-0.93). Predation by wolves (Canis lupus) and other predators was implicated as the most common cause of death for adult caribou in northeast Alberta. Pregnancy rates (90-100\%) and calf production (75-95\%) were relatively high in all caribou ranges; however, mean annual recruitment was near or below 20 calves per 100 cows in most ranges (x = 17.1, range = 11.4-22.7). Caribou populations in 3 ranges have declined at average rates exceeding those that would lead to a 50\% decline from initial population size over 3 generations; another population is declining at half this rate. Populations of caribou in 2 ranges appear to be stable, declining marginally since inception of our study. The current distribution, intensity, amount, and type of human activity in and near caribou ranges is likely compromising the integrity of caribou habitat. Treatment of declines will require new land-use guidelines that promote caribou conservation.},
