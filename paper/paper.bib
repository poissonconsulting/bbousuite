	abstract = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This article provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM). Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are threatened in Canada, with population and distribution declines evident in most regions of the country. Causes of declines are linked to landscape change from forest ﬁres and human development, notably forestry oil and gas activities, which result in caribou habitat loss and affect ecosystem food webs. The Federal Species at Risk Act requires effective protection and restoration of caribou habitat, with actions to increase caribou survival. These requirements call for effective monitoring of caribou population trends to gauge success. Many woodland caribou populations are nearly impossible to count using traditional aerial survey methods, but demographic-based monitoring approaches can be used to estimate population trends based on population modeling of vital rates from marked animals. Monitoring programs have used a well-known simple population model (the Recruitment-Mortality [R/M] equation) to estimate demographic rates for woodland caribou, but have faced challenges in managing large data streams and providing transparency in the demographic estimation process. We present a stand-alone statistical software application using open-source software to permit efﬁcient, transparent, and replicable demographic estimation for woodland caribou populations. We developed an easy-to-use, interactive web-based application for the R/M population model that uses a Bayesian estimation approach and provides the user ﬂexibility in choice of prior distributions and other output features. We illustrate the web-application to the A la P{\textasciicircum}eche Southern Mountain (Central Group) woodland caribou population in west-central Alberta, Canada, during 1998–2017. Our estimates of population demographics are consistent with previous research on this population and highlight the utility of the application in assessing caribou population responses to species recovery actions. We provide example data, computer code, the web-based application package, and a user manual to guide installation and use. We also review underlying assumptions and challenges of population monitoring in this case study. We expect our software will contribute to efﬁcient monitoring of woodland caribou and help in the assessment of recovery actions for this species. Ó 2019 The Authors.
